# NodePulse

A blockchain node monitoring tool built on Stacks, providing transparent and secure node performance tracking.

## Overview

NodePulse is a decentralized solution for monitoring and verifying blockchain node performance. It enables node operators to register their nodes, receive performance validations from verified observers, and earn rewards for maintaining high-quality infrastructure. The system uses a comprehensive smart contract architecture to ensure transparency, accuracy, and fair incentivization.

## Architecture

The system consists of four main components:

1. **Node Registry**: Manages node identities, registration, and status tracking
2. **Performance Reporting**: Collects and stores node performance metrics
3. **Metric Verification**: Ensures data integrity through multi-party verification
4. **Governance**: Enables community oversight and protocol updates
5. **Rewards Distribution**: Incentivizes accurate reporting and high performance

## Smart Contracts

### Node Registry (`node-registry`)

The central registry for all monitored nodes in the system.

Key features:
- Node registration and management
- Status tracking (active/inactive/maintenance)
- Support for multiple blockchain networks
- Node ownership verification

### Performance Reporting (`performance-reporting`)

Handles collection and storage of node performance metrics.

Key features:
- Metric submission and storage
- Historical performance tracking
- Performance data validation
- Timestamp-based reporting

### Metric Verification (`metric-verification`)

Ensures data integrity through multi-party verification.

Key features:
- Verification process management
- Anomaly detection
- Reputation tracking
- Verification thresholds

### Governance (`governance`)

Enables decentralized control of the protocol.

Key features:
- Proposal creation and voting
- Parameter updates
- Dispute resolution
- Community feedback

### Rewards Distribution (`rewards-distribution`)

Manages incentives for participants.

Key features:
- Performance-based rewards
- Verification incentives
- Epoch-based distribution
- Reputation-weighted allocations

## Usage

### Node Registration

```clarity
;; Register a new node
(contract-call? .node-registry register-node
    "my-node"
    u2  ;; NETWORK-STACKS
    "us-east"
    "16GB RAM, 8 cores"
    u1   ;; STATUS-ACTIVE
)
```

### Submitting Performance Data

```clarity
;; Submit node performance metrics
(contract-call? .performance-reporting submit-node-performance
    node-id
    uptime
    response-time
)
```

### Verifying Metrics

```clarity
;; Verify submitted metrics
(contract-call? .metric-verification verify-metric
    node-id
    metric-id
    verification-result
)
```

### Governance Participation

```clarity
;; Create a proposal
(contract-call? .governance create-proposal
    "Update Verification Threshold"
    "Proposal to adjust verification requirements"
    u1  ;; PARAM-CHANGE
    (some "verification-threshold")
    (some "5")
)
```

### Claiming Rewards

```clarity
;; Claim rewards for an epoch
(contract-call? .rewards-distribution claim-rewards epoch-number)
```

## Security Considerations

1. Multi-party verification required for metric validation
2. Reputation-based weighting for verifier influence
3. Time-locked governance actions
4. Anomaly detection for suspicious metrics
5. Stake-based participation requirements
